# First_JS-Handlebars_Project
- - - -
## About
This is a simple project where I am exploring JavaScript Handlebars.
+ You can view the tutorial that I'm using to learn it 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQSEXcf6s2I&list=PLCC34OHNcOtoC6GglhF3ncJ5rLwQrLGnV).
+ You can also learn about Handlebars [here](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars).

## Challenge:
In the tutorial, the tutorial guide had downloaded and installed Handlebars. I didn't want to eat up time doing that.

## Solution:
I found the cdn [link](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/handlebars.js) and integrated that into my [index.html](https://github.com/Ethan-Amsden/First_JS-Handlebars_Project/blob/master/index.html) file.
